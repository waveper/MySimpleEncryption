My Simple Encryption?

Not really.. just a Bitwise-NOT encoder

Input from the terminal
Output to the terminal

"What about the decoder? (my thoughts while I'm lying in bed)"
okay, just someday. I'll code that
I'll add it to this to-do list

___TODO___
Decoder (probability: 1 in 1000000000000000000000000000000)

AANNnnndddddd, the actual Encryption!(xor encryption + bitwise-not encoder/decoder ofcourse) (probability: 1 in 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000990000000000000000000)

This is all I could think of
