My Simple Encryption?

Not really.. just a Bitwise-NOT encoder

Input from the terminal
Output to the terminal

"What about the decoder? (my thoughts while I'm lying in bed)"
okay, just someday. I'll code that
I'll add it to this to-do list

___TODO___
Joining all the command line arguments without the user needing to double quote every time (probability: 1 in 10000000000000000)
Decoder (probability: 1 in 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

AANNnnndddddd, the actual Encryption!(xor encryption + bitwise-not encoder/decoder ofcourse) (probability: 1 in 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

This is all I could think of
