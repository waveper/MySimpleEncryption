My Simple Encryption?

Not really.. just a Bitwise-NOT encoder

Input from the terminal
Output to the terminal

"what about the decoder?(my toughts while im laying in bed)"
okay, just someday. I'll code that
I'll add it in this todo list

___TODO___
Joining all the command line arguments without the user need to double quote every time (probability: 1 in 10000000000000000)
Decoder (probability: 1 in 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

AANNnnndddddd, the actual Encryption!(xor encryption + bitwise-not encoder/decoder ofcourse) (probability l: 1 in 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

this is all i could think
